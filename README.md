# trane-guitar

This repository contains courses for the guitar designed to be used with
[Trane](https://github.com/trane-project/trane). It is in active development and new material is
being added.

## Building

Building is not needed for most users. All the course materials are kept under the `courses/`
directory and can be used immediately.

These course materials are built by running the binary under the `src/` directory. If you want to
rebuild the courses, use the Makefile provided along by executing `make build_courses`. This command
requires that a stable version of the Rust toolchain is installed.

## Usage

For instructions on how to use Trane, please refer to the [quick start
guide](https://trane-project.github.io/quick_start.html).

## Contributing

`trane-guitar` is open for contributions, ranging from course requests to fully built courses. See
the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for more details.
